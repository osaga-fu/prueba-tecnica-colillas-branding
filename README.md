Junior Frontend Technical Test for Colillas Branding

# Design

I followed the HTML element naming and structure provided in Figma to complete the task.

I have decided to divide the main CSS into small CSS files, each one associated with a small section of the page. All of these files can be found in the **styles** folder. This improves readability and code reusability.

All of the fonts used for the project are imported via link from google fonts and then used when needed.

# JavaScript

I have created javascript functionality for the app. All the scripts can be found on the **scripts** folder.

## Test

I have also created a test for one of the javascript methods. Use the following command to install jest:

```
npm npm install --save-dev jest

npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom

```
The test can be found on the folder **\_\_tests\_\_**

In order to run the test you need to insert the following command

```
npm test
```
