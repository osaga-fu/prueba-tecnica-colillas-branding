Junior Frontend Technical Test for Colillas Branding

# Design

I followed the HTML element naming and structure provided in Figma to complete the task.

I have decided to divide the main CSS into small CSS files, each one associated with a small section of the page. All of these files can be found in the styles folder. This improves readability and code reusability.

All of the fonts used for the project are imported via link from google fonts and then used when needed.
