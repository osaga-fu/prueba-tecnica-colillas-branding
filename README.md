Junior Frontend Technical Test for Colillas Branding

# Design

I followed the HTML element naming and structure provided in Figma to complete the task.

I have decided to divide the main CSS into small CSS files, each one associated with a small section of the page. All of these files can be found in the **styles** folder. This improves readability and code reusability.

All of the fonts used for the project are imported via link from google fonts and then used when needed.

# JavaScript

I have created javascript functionality for the app. All the scripts can be found on the **scripts** folder.

## Tests

I have also created the test for those javascript methods. In order to check those test you should use the following command to install jest:

```
nnpm install --save-dev jest
```
All of the test can be found on the folder **\_\_tests\_\_**
